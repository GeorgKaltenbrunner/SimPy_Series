# SimPy_Series
This repository stores the code for the Medium articles to Simulation with SimPy and Machine Learning – Sereis

## first_article_basic_model.py
This file contains the code for the first article of this series. There the code is described in more detail (see: https://medium.com/@georgkaltenbrunner/first-article-simulation-with-simpy-and-applying-machine-learning-d2f5cfaa5823)

## second_article_sequencing_release.py
This file extends the basic model by an order pool. This enables the usage of order sequencing and order release
approaches. On medium the code is described in more detail (see: https://medium.com/@georgkaltenbrunner/second-article-simulation-with-simpy-and-applying-machine-learning-84c3f7cff6f4)
